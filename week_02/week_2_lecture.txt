In-class Lab (Test Script)

Assignment (Final Report)















Plan for your data collection workflow.

- How you will be taking notes.
- Which software you will use: Google Forms, Excel.














For example



Note observations in two columns:


1) Questions/Tasks

"The task is to find how to contact us"

2) What happened during the test

"User clicked on 'Home' button instead of 'Contact us'"


















Task analysis

When you observe how participants perform
the tasks pay attention to:

- What participants should know before starting the task?

- What participants should know in order to complete the task?

- What triggers participant to start the task?

- How will participants know that task is complete?

- What tools/information participants use to perform the task?














How to perform tests

- Set up test environment. Make sure that your website works.

- Explain the purpose of the test, brief them on the tasks.

- Each test should be performed in exact same manner according to test script.
This ensures accurate data collection.














If test is moderated, responsibilities:

- Guide participants

- Observe & take notes
















How to create a good test script?

- Intro

Set comfortable environment.
Tell how long the test will be.
Get their permissions to record the test if necessary.
Ask demographic questions.
Ask if participant has any questions.

- Define tasks

Explain 3-5 task scenarios.
Prepare questions you want to ask during/after task completion.

- Post-study

After task is completed ask for a feedback.
General impression of the test.
Is website useful?














Data Compilation












Prepare your data for analysis

For quantitative data (e.g. How many errors participant made?):

- Sum up all the values.

For qualitative data (e.g. Is error message visible?):

- Write down the full answers from your participants or your observations.

Data Analysis













For example:

Question:
Are users regularly able to complete the 'checkout'
task in under 120 seconds?

Based on collected data we have:

- average completion 96 sec
- min completion 88 sec
- max completion 104 sec
- 0 critical errors were observed.

Conclusion:
We can conclude that the 'checkout' task does not require a redesign.

Facts, observed during tests, should support your conclusion.














Reporting Solutions

- Things to improve

- Things to investigate further












Suggestions:

- Keep solutions specific & positive.

- Present pros & cons.

- Organize your solutions based on severity










Question to keep in mind when creating the report

What you did?
Why you did it?
How you did it?
What you have learned?
What should be done?
What data backs up your findings?









The goal of the report to point to problems and propose solutions.

- Be specific, provide details.
- Don't be negative, it's not the user's fault.
- Don't recommend making small changes to a big problem.
- Align with the client's priorities & help to prioritize.
- Use formal language.












In-class Lab


1. Create your Usability Test Script for your website.
This script should resonate with The Brief which you created earlier.

2. Find classmate and perform usability test according to your Test Script.
Collect data, make notes.

3. Using provided blank document fill-in your Test Script and the results from it.

4. Show to me in-class & upload to the blackboard.
