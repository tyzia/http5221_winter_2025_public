10 Heuristics of Usability

Usability Testing

Test Plan (The Brief)

In-class lab (individual & group part) Heuristics

Assignment - Test Plan























Usability
















" Web usability - The extent to which specified users can find,
understand and use information and services online."

                Government of Canada, Standard on Web Usability














Usability - how people will use your website.
















Usability test - to determine if the website is usable.















Heuristics - a checklist of usability principles which we should consider
when we build our website, if we want it to be usable.


The most well-known - 10 Usability Heuristics of Jakob Nielsen

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/













Heuristic Evaluation - inspecting the website according to usability heuristics.











Example of Heuristic Evaluation of a website based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.












https://reservations.ontarioparks.ca/

















1. Visibility of System Status

- When user selects campground, they can see loading indicators.









2. Match Between System and the Real World

- Familiar language ('campground', 'backcountry', etc.) is used.












3. User Control and Freedom

- Users can easily navigate back.












4. Consistency and Standards

- The design follows common web conventions: Sign in, Cart, Reservations.













5. Error Prevention

- The site could enhance error prevention by making default value for Equipment field.













6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

- When I select Mew Lake campground I see it belongs to Algonquin park.
- Legend below the map.













7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

- Saved searches for returning users can improve efficiency.












8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

- The design is mostly clean and minimalist.












9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

- Error messages are present helping users how to fix their issues.













10. Help and Documentation

- FAQ page.
- Descriptions of the campgrounds.



















Usability Testing













For this we will need:


- Who is going to use our website?

- Test how these people actually using our website.

- Interpret the test data.

- Make recommendations how to improve usability.
















- What to test
- Scope of testing
- Questions
- Participants
- Methods
- Metrics
- Scenarios
- Schedule & Location
- Equipment














What to expect next in the course:

1. Learn how to create your Test Plan.
2. Perform user testing according to your Test Plan.
3. Collect test data and create a Test Report.














What to test?

- Your website or app which you have built.

Why yours?

- To test if your website it usable.














Scope
















- What you test and why.
- Be as specific as possible about what exactly you are testing.
- What you do not test and why.












Questions











- Specify the questions which you want to get answers for.
- Explain why these questions matter for you as website owner.







For example:

- Can my users find Search button?
It is important because the main feature of my website is search movie database.

- Does dropdown menu work better than breadcrumbs?
It is important because I have a lot of options and need to decide if I would use
dropdowns or breadcrumbs.

- Do users learn the interface in under 3 seconds?
I expect that users get familiar with the website quickly.














Participants














What are the demographics of people you are testing?

- Age, sex, level of education, income.

How many people you are testing?

I recommend to test 5 people:

- Can be your classmates.
- Can be your friends outside the classroom.

Why you have chosen this group of people?

- This group should be the best match for the scope of your testing.

No need in personal details (name, address, contact details).











Methods
















What methods you will use in your test?

- Heuristic Evaluation (specify which heuristics).

- Discovery (finding problems by observing users perform tasks).

- Benchmark (test how well solutions perform).

- Is your test moderated or not?

-- Moderated - when there is a moderator who tells participants what to do.
-- Not moderated - when participants have a task and should complete it individually.












Metrics

















- What you will measure.

- How will you measure it?

- What data you will be collecting.

- Why this data is important?

- Are you sure that a metric will help you to answer your question?








Examples of metrics:


- Successful task completion.

How many participants have completed the task?

- Critical Errors.

How many critical errors did participants make?
What are critical errors?
Why they matter for your test?

- Non-critical Errors.

- Error-free rate.

How many participants completed the task without any errors?

- Time on Task.

How much time did participant spend on task?
Is it long?
Why this matters?

- Happiness from using the feature.

"Is this reservation process was easy to complete"
Strongly Agree - Agree - Neutral - Disagree - Strongly Disagree

- Comments or Recommendations from the participants.













Scenarios














- Each scenario provides a context in order to allow participant to better
understand the activity.

- What are the most important things that every user must be able
to accomplish on your application?

- Create tasks that address your test goals.

- Base your scenarios on what do you want your users to do?

- What do they usually look for on your website?











Schedule and Location











When you plan to perform the tests?
Where this will happen?
It can be online.













Equipment











Which OS, computer or device your participants will be using for testing.













Once you have all this organized, you will create a Test Plan (sometimes called Brief)











Brief

















Brief should consist of the following:

- [09] Executive Summary.
- [01] Scope.
- [02] Questions.
- [03] Participants.
- [04] Methods.
- [05] Metrics.
- [06] Schedule & Location.
- [07] Equipment.
- [08] Scenarios.


[N] - number in the brackets is the suggestion
in which order to creat this parts.










Executive Summary

The whole plan summarized in 1-2 paragraphs.













In-class Lab


1. Perform a Heuristic Evaluation of the website
https://torontocupcake.com/ based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.

2. Individually evaluate the website.
For each of the 10 heuristics, identify one or more examples where
the website either:

- Follows the heuristic well, or
- Needs improvement.

Document your findings in the template.

3. Once youâ€™ve completed your individual evaluation,
form a group of 3-5 students. Compare your individual findings,
discuss them, and agree on the final evaluation for each heuristic.

Document the group's findings in the template.

4. Show both your individual and group documents to your instructor
in-class and submit via Blackboard.
